# Project-Status-Report
The goal of this project was to consolidate information for our corporate project management system (Workfront) and create a one page printable report that Managers can review with customers about current project information from within the tool. This report was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Angular.

The project is using the Workfront API to retreive data for the report.
